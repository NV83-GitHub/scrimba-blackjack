# scrimba-blackjack

Follow along tutorial from scrimba's front-end developer career path , module 3 "code a BlackJack game" it was a good refresher on subjects like


<ul>
  <li>primitive datatypes</li>
  <li>complex datatypes, Arrays and Objects</li>
  <li>Function basics</li>
  <li>Return statements</li>
  <li>For loops</li>
  <li>if else if else</li>
  <li>Logical operator && and ||</li>
  <li>Comparaison operator</li>
  <li>Math object</li>
  <li>Overal a really good introductory course on JS</li>
</ul>

i started adding my own modifications to go further as :

<ul>
  <li>Adding logic to deduce player chips at each new games</li>
  <li>Reconnect file structure to work outside Scrimba</li>
  <li>change Background</li>
</ul>

It could be better with: 

<ul>
  <li>logic to add chips to player stack when he wins BlackJack</li>
  <li>Showing Cards images instead of just the numbers</li>
  <li>Arrange layout and fonts for better look</li>
  <li>Correct game logic to include player choice on value of the ace card (1 or 11)</li>
  <li>Responsive design</li>
</ul>
